<h1>Tanks Battle</h1>

<p> Tanks battle is a one player game where the player has to protect by any means necessary the bird from the enemies.
You have unlimited bombshells for that purpose and the AI behind the enemies isn't very evolved. For now, there's just a rand behind the movements of the enemies.
I wanted to use Djisktra or A* to make the movements at least more intelligent but I wasn't able to do that because of the delay. 
The enemies are different tanks which can have a better armor. There are three different level of armor : 1 to 3.
The player will won if he destroys all the enemies of the level and lose if Piou Piou is touched by an bombshell.</p>


<h2> Working in progress </h2>
<ul> 
<li> Generate and move more than one enemy tank in the map  -- DONE
<li> Develop the algorithm which will make the tank a bit more intelligent (only shooting when the user's tank is on the line of sight, go to the same direction for twenty steps before switching)
<li> Attacking other tanks
</ul>
